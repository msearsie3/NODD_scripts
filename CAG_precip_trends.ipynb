    "This is a Jupyter Notebook meant to facilitate the analysis of precipitation data over time, using historical records stored at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Users will download and analyze real scientific data and see the precipitation trends in their desired region of the United States or the globe. Because users will be using real local data, some data records may be incomplete. As such, it is important to use scientific analysis skills to assess the usability of the chosen dataset and resulting analyses. "

    "    3. Choose a Time Scale of 12-month. \n",
    "    4. Choose the month of December, so we get a yearly average for Jan - Dec. \n",
    "    5. Choose whichever start and end year you'd like. I'd recommend downloading the full range of data. \n",
    "    6. Uncheck the \"Display Base Period\" box to the right of the drop-down menus. \n",
    "    7. On the website, click \"Plot\" to visualize the data you've chosen. Does it look like what you want?\n",
