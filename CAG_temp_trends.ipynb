    "#### **Intent:** Build familiarity with NOAA's Climate at a Glance dataset and the analysis of climate trends.           \n",
    "#### **Outcome:** Statistics, graphs, and plots of temperature trends.           \n",
    "This is a Jupyter Notebook meant to facilitate the analysis of temperature data over time, using historical records stored at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Users will download and analyze real scientific data and see the temperature trends in their desired region of the United States or the globe. Because users will be using real local data, some data records may be incomplete. As such, it is important to use scientific analysis skills to assess the usability of the chosen dataset and resulting analyses. "

    "    1. Click on the tab of your desired region (i.e. Nation, State, Division, etc.), then launch \"Time Series\"\n",
    "    2. Choose your temperature Parameter (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, or average temperature).\n",
    "    3. Choose a Time Scale of 12-month. \n",
    "    4. Choose the month of December, so we get a yearly average for Jan - Dec. \n",
    "    5. Choose whichever start and end year you'd like. I'd recommend downloading the full range of data. \n",
    "    6. Uncheck the \"Display Base Period\" box to the right of the drop-down menus. \n",
    "    7. On the website, click \"Plot\" to visualize the data you've chosen. Does it look like what you want?\n",
    "    8. Below the plot, there's an option to Download the data. Download it as a CSV. \n",
    "9. **(***If using Binder***) Return to your Binder window and:**\n",
    "    1. Click the \"Upload Files\" button just below the \"Run\" tab. It looks like an up arrow with a line underneath. Upload the csv file you just downloaded in step 1, and make sure it appears in your list of files.\n",
    "    2. Then, right-click the csv file and click the option \"Rename.\" Change the name of the csv file to \"climate_data.csv\"\n",
    "9. **(***If not using Binder***) Return to the program you're using to run the notebook and:** \n",
    "    1. Save the csv file you just downloaded in the same directory as your Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "    2. Change the name of your csv file to \"climate_data.csv\"\n",
    "10. **You may begin the notebook!**\n",
